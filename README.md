# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using classification algorithms and data analysis techniques.

## üîç Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning techniques. Fraud detection is a critical challenge in the financial sector due to the high volume of transactions and the imbalance between legitimate and fraudulent cases. In this project, we use a publicly available dataset containing anonymized features derived from real-world European cardholder transactions. The objective is to build models that can accurately classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), handling class imbalance using techniques like SMOTE, and applying classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. The ultimate goal is to minimize false negatives (fraudulent transactions predicted as normal) while maintaining overall model reliability. This project demonstrates the application of data science and machine learning in solving real-world problems and highlights the importance of careful data handling and model evaluation in sensitive domains like fraud detection.
